# VotingSimulation
Netlogo Multi-Agent model that simulates the voting tendence based on your neighbours behaviour, economics, loyalty and party political placement.

This project is an expansion of Netlogo's multi agent model of "Voting Sensibilty". It has been severely expanded as follows:
1) Original model simulates two parties, this model extends to 4 parties.
2) Included a loyalty effect.
3) Defined a political orientation of each voter.
4) Included Economic dynamics.
5) Used Small world and random networks scenarios.
